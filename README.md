## Task

### What will I be doing?

As a work placement student, your task over the next 4 days is to help us create and design a dashboard focused on public domain data related to higher education. The data in particular is from **HESA**, the **Higher Education Statistics Agency**, who are the main data collector for higher education in the UK. The data focuses on **Graduate Outcomes**, providing statistics on the type of employment students go into after leaving university.

> **What is higher education?** Higher education refers to university-level education, at either undergraduate or postgraduate (masters) level.

### Why is this important to Navitas?

Navitas likes to research and provide statistical analsysis to our colleages, which could help to strategically inform the business. It allows us to research our current partners as well as future partners. With statistical data like **Graduate Outcomes**, we see where students of our partners go on to study - as these students may have been Navitas students at some point.

### How will I be supported? 

**Adam Lowe**, Global Data Engineer, and **Tife Kusimo**, Global Data Analyst, will be supporting you every step of the way. Some of the task may see you shadowing us, but we will be sure to include you in our work so you can learn and understand.

As the Navitas technical team is **fully remote**, we will communicate via **Zoom**. We will use **Zoom** for chat messages and video calling.

We will have a morning check in at 10am each day and an afternoon check in at 1pm.

## Getting Started

Download and install the following programmes:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Our main programming language. We will use this for running scripts and doing analysis work.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   - An Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, allowing us to programme.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - A way to manage our files and track changes, also called source control.
3. [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
   - A powerful data visualisation application which is used across our business.
4. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)
   - Our chosen way to communicate with external people

## Setting up the repo

A **repo**, or **repository**, is a collection of tracked files hosted in a space. You can think of them as folders. **Repos** allow us to create a structured collection of files, programmes and more.

1. Create a new folder on your machine called **code**
2. Open the folder and right-click anywhere in the white space and select **Open in Terminal**
3. In the **Termnal** windows, type `git clone https://github.com/ALoweNavitas/graduate-outcomes` and hit **Enter**
4. Your machine will download the repo.

### Downloading the required files

1. Once you have cloned the **repo**, open the folder, right click anywhere in the white space and click **Open with code**
2. **Visual Studio Code** will now open. In the explorer view panel, click on `download-files.ipynb`
3. In the header bar, click **Terminal > New Terminal** to open a terminal window
4. Type `pip install requirements.txt`. This will install the required **Python** packages for this repo.
3. Click **Run all** and the files will now be downloaded

> It is recommended to create a virtual environment to run this repo as to not effect your global Python environment

## Key Contacts

Adam Lowe will be your main contact. Reach out via the following if you need anything at all:

- Zoom: [adamlowenavitas](zoom.us.my/adamlowenavitas)
- Mobile: 07387024195

## Training Resources

Whilst you will be working with us, as part of your placement you will be required to complete training modules which will establish you with the base skills to assist with the task. These should be completed as part of your working hours, and put into practice on the files used in the task.
